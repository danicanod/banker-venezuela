## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

La seguridad es nuestra máxima prioridad. Si descubres una vulnerabilidad de seguridad, por favor repórtala de manera responsable.

### 📧 Proceso de Reporte

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email us directly**: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
2. **Subject line**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of issue`
3. **Include**:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Triage**: Within 48 hours  
- **Fix Development**: 1-7 days (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

### 🏆 Security Acknowledgments

We maintain a security hall of fame for responsible disclosures:

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### 🏦 Banking Data Handling

This project handles sensitive banking credentials and data. Key security principles:

#### ✅ What We DO:
- Store credentials **only** in environment variables
- Use **temporary browser sessions** without persistence
- Implement **isolated browser contexts** per execution
- **Clear memory** of sensitive data after use
- **No logging** of credentials or sensitive information
- Use **HTTPS only** for all banking communications

#### ❌ What We DON'T:
- Store banking credentials in code or config files
- Persist session cookies or tokens
- Log sensitive banking information
- Share credentials between executions
- Use unencrypted connections

### 🛡️ Browser Security

#### Isolation Measures:
```typescript
// Each execution uses isolated context
const context = await browser.newContext({
  clearCookies: true,
  clearLocalStorage: true,
  ignoreHTTPSErrors: false,
  javaScriptEnabled: true,
  // Additional security headers
});
```

#### Resource Blocking:
- Block non-essential resources to reduce attack surface
- Disable unnecessary browser features
- Use minimal required permissions

### 🔒 Environment Security

#### Required Practices:
- **Never commit** `.env` files
- Use **strong, unique passwords** for banking accounts
- Regularly **rotate credentials**
- Run in **isolated environments** (Docker recommended)
- Use **read-only** filesystem where possible

#### Environment Variables:
```bash
# ✅ Good - Environment variables
BANESCO_USERNAME=your_username
BANESCO_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# ❌ Bad - Hard-coded in source
const username = "my_username"; // NEVER DO THIS
```

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### 🏦 Banking Website Changes

Banks frequently update their security measures. This can affect:

- **Anti-bot detection**: May block automated access
- **Session timeouts**: More aggressive timeout policies
- **Multi-factor authentication**: New 2FA requirements
- **CAPTCHA systems**: Visual verification challenges

### 🤖 Detection Mitigation

We implement several techniques to appear as legitimate users:

- **Human-like timing**: Variable delays between actions
- **Real browser**: Full Chromium instance, not headless-only
- **Standard user agent**: Legitimate browser identification
- **Mouse movements**: Simulated human interactions
- **Realistic navigation**: Following expected user flows

### 🔐 Session Management

- **No persistent storage**: Sessions are temporary only
- **Automatic cleanup**: Browser data cleared after each run
- **Session isolation**: Each execution starts fresh
- **Memory management**: Sensitive data cleared from memory

## 📊 Security Audit Checklist

Before each release, we verify:

- [ ] No credentials in source code
- [ ] Environment variables properly validated
- [ ] Browser sessions properly isolated
- [ ] Memory cleared of sensitive data
- [ ] HTTPS-only communications
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Logging doesn't include credentials
- [ ] Dependencies updated for security patches

## 🔍 Dependency Security

### Automated Scanning:
- **npm audit**: Regular vulnerability scans
- **Dependabot**: Automated security updates
- **Playwright**: Latest version with security patches

### Manual Review:
- Regular review of dependency tree
- Verification of package integrity
- Monitoring security advisories

## 📋 Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection:
- **Minimal data collection**: Only necessary banking data
- **Temporary storage**: No persistent data storage
- **User consent**: Clear documentation of data usage
- **Data retention**: Immediate cleanup after processing

### Banking Regulations:
- **Terms of Service**: Users must comply with bank TOS
- **Personal use only**: Not for commercial data scraping
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful usage patterns
- **Error handling**: Graceful failures without retries

## 🛠️ Security Tools

### Development:
```bash
# Security audit
npm audit

# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level moderate

# Fix automatically
npm audit fix
```

### Runtime:
- Browser sandboxing enabled
- Network request monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Error boundary implementation
